# Expo CLI Error: Version Mismatch or Dependency Conflicts

This repository demonstrates a common Expo CLI error caused by version mismatches between the CLI and project dependencies.  The `bug.js` file showcases a project setup that may trigger this error, while `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the solution.

## Problem
The error message typically indicates a failure to resolve dependencies due to version conflicts. This often stems from outdated or conflicting entries in the project's `package.json` file.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the Expo CLI version and all project dependencies are compatible.  This may require:

1. **Updating the Expo CLI:** Use `npm install -g expo-cli@latest` or `yarn global add expo-cli@latest` to get the newest version.
2. **Cleaning the project's node modules:** Delete the `node_modules` folder and run `npm install` or `yarn install` to rebuild dependencies.
3. **Checking `package.json`:**  Ensure there are no conflicting dependency versions or typos.
4. **Using a package manager lock file:** Make use of `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` to ensure consistent dependency versions across different environments.
5. **Reinstalling Expo dependencies:**  `expo install expo` may resolve certain conflicts.

By addressing these points, we can restore compatibility and resolve the Expo CLI errors related to version mismatches.
